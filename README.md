### A simple app that takes your history of blunders and lets you practice making better moves.

Similar to tactical puzzles, you see a position then choose a move. Unlike tactical puzzles, many good moves might exist. While most people review mistakes directly after a game, it's trickier to remember a mistake from ten games ago. This app stores a history of positions you find difficult, not just from the last game played. In this manner you can understand your mistakes, gaining knowledge, then drill those positions to turn the knowledge into skill.
